# NoSQL-SocialNetworkAPI
## Module 18 Challenge

# Description 
The purpose of this challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The following technologies were used to create this social network API: ExpressJS, NodeJs, Mongoose, and Mongoose ODM.

# Installation
